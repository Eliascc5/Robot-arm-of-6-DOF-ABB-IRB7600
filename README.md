# Robot-arm-of-6-DOF-ABB-IRB7600-Kinematics-


In this project, we work on the kinematic concepts of an industrial robot with 6 degrees of freedom. It is about an ABB commercial robot model IRB 7600-400/2.55..
We guide the project towards a real industrial application, such as the pouring of molten steel into crucibles. We consider it to be a risky application for a human operator.
