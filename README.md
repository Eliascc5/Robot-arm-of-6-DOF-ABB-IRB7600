# Robot-arm-of-6-DOF-ABB-IRB7600-Kinematics-

This is the final project of the Robotics I module at the National University of Cuyo, Mendoza - Argentina.

In this project, we worked on the kinematic aspects of an industrial robot with 6 degrees of freedom. It was about an ABB commercial robot model IRB 7600-400/2.55..
We guided the project towards a real industrial application, such as the pouring of molten steel into crucibles. We considered it to be a risky application for a human operator.

To carry out the project, we used Matlab as a tool (to develop the code) and Peter Cork's toolbox available to link it to Maltab.

More specifically, the topics that were treated were:

<ul>
<li>Axis assignment</li>
<li>Determination of the parameters of the Denavit - Hartenberg matrix</li>
<li>Direct kinematics</li>
<li>Inverse kinematics (Geometric method) -- Validation with numerical method provided by the toolbox</li>
<li>Direct and inverse Jacobian matrix</li>
<li>Singularities</li>
<li>Work space</li>
<li>Trajectory planning</li>
</ul>
